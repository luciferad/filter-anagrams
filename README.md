## 1.5.7: Filter Anagrams

This is solution to the filter anagrams challenge on Javascript.info.
Part 1, chapter 5, heading 7, exercise 2, filter anagrams

## Description

This function gets an array of anagrams and returns an array which cleaned from anagrams.

## My Process

First of all I solve the challenge based on what I've learned from javascript.info & then I try to improve my code. Finally I write code according to the javascript.info solution.
For this exercise I wrote a code could return an array cleaned from anagrams. It returned a new cleaned array of words every time you executed it; not a unique array same as javascript.info solution.
It produced a set of unique characters-sorted words based on the anagrams. Then It generate a map with the key and value. The keys were each unique characters-sorted word from the set and values were the array of words which were related to each keys.
At the end, it made a result array of random words which was cleaned from anagrams.
My solution was more advanced than the javascript.info solution.
Finally I Modified the code based on the javascript.info solution.
